  &gt; Anything else we should know or that you want to say can also go
  here<br>
  <br>
  My moderating style - surprised that this wasn't asked
  about<br>
  <br>
  I moderate some rules leniently, some rules strictly. I'm generally strict
  with individual posts. So if there's a rule breaking post, I'll remove it
  with a removal reason given<br>
  <br>
  If I remove a comment(I'm more
  lenient out here, I generally encourage discussion), I always inform the user
  and tell them what rule they're breaking<br>
  <br>
  I tend to stay a bit more silent in modmail, for example if another mod bans
  a user and the user demands a reason, I leave it to the mod to explain
  it(unless it's like a clear troll)<br>
  <br>
  But if there's a mod discussion going on in modmail(which won't happen as
  you said that you use Slack) I usually jump in!<br>
  <br>
  Also, I get
  that the_donald being in my modding history may seem a bit controversial, but
  it's where I gained experience - there was a ton of modding to do out there,
  modqueue was almost never empty and I had about 3400 mod actions a
  month<br>

  <br>
  Generally, those under the age of 16 jump on a 'band-wagon'
  of insulting - and can greatly affect the way they develop. At 16, most
  people are considered wise enough to be able to make the wise decision, and
  would refrain from posting themselves on the sub if they felt like it would
  affect them badly.<br>
  <br>
  An issue with this, however is that (especially in the EU), the internet is
  generally regarded as a place for those over 13. This causes a void between
  the age restriction of reddit, and the age restriction of the sub, however
  this void in my opinion is negligible - users wellbeing is more important to
  me than being able to post.</td>

  I have browsed through this subreddit almost since I signed up (Sep 2015)
  and have always been amused by the content on the page. Being part of the
  team that bring such humour to so a quarter of a million people is something
  that would be pretty fun, and considering I've become a sight more active

  <td class=xl67>Honestly, the minimum age rule change would have been my only
  rule change, otherwise, the sub is running good. There are no rules I would
  change but if one were to change that I wouldn't be indifferent to, then
  maybe &quot;only 1 person in the picture&quot;, so no group roasts but yeah
  as I said, I would be indifferent to it, so it doesn't bother me either way.</td>
  <td class=xl71>I'm a long time lurker and commenter on the sub and I am well
  equipped with the rules of the sub. I have lots of moderating experience and
  I'm on Reddit everyday for around 5 hours+. Additionally, being from
  Australia is quite a bonus, as I will be active when most other mods will
  likely be sleeping, which can ensure the sub will always be modded, which is
  super ideal for fast modmail replies.<br>
  <br>
  I hope you will consider my application and good luck with the outcome

  <td class=xl73>It might just be a personal thing but I feel like the bright
  red [VERIFIED ROASTEE] flair seems a bit much on the eyes. Maybe shorten it
  to VR? At /r/RateMe, once a post is approved and viewable by the public,
  everyone just does their thing without the need for a giant flair. I
  understand it goes with the roasted meats theme and it helps for repeat
  roastees, but it's not very appealing on the eyes, especially when it
  contrasts the green stickied posts. It might just be me though.<br>
  <br>
  On a different
  note, how about having a &quot;word of the day/week&quot; challenge sort of
  thing? Like for 24 hours, users try to roast people and compare them to an
  object in the roast. Afterwards, other users will nominate and vote which
  roast best used that word. It doesn't have to be a contest either, it could
  just encourage users to be more creative!</td>
  <td class=xl74>I don't participate in the roasts, but I do like reading posts
  for some great (and admittedly sometimes vulgar and immature) humor. I love
  to help out in any way that I can. In /r/rateme, there's a similar
  verification process by approving posts in the mod queue, and I like being a
  part of the process to move things along. It's a different environment over
  there as I usually have to remove crazy comments instead; so this would be an
  interesting change! Thank you for your time. :)</td>
